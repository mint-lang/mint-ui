/*
A generic global modal component.

Some of its features:

- When open pressing `Esc` closes it.

- After opened it will focus the first focusable item (which usually is the
  close icon).

- Showing the component returns a promise which is resolved when its closed or
  rejected when cancelled.

- The keyboard focus is trapped in the list: `Tab` and `Shift-Tab` cycles
  focusable elements.

- When closed the focus is returned to the last focused element before opening
  (which is usually the one that opened the modal).
